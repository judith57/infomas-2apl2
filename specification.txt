Task announcement:
The manager sends a request message to every contractor: 
send(Receiver, announce, Content).
The Content of the message is the name of the component that the manager needs.

Bid:
When a contrator recieves the announce message, it checks whether it has the requested hardware available and replies:
send(Receiver, bid, Content). 
If the contractor has the requested hardware available, Content is the price. Otherwise, the Content of the message will be "unavailable".

Award:
When every contractor has replied, the manager chooses the best bid and replies to that contractor:
send(Receiver, award, Content).
To the other contractors, it replies:
send(Receiver, cancel, Content).
In both cases, Content is the name of the component.
